1. *Well-defined Project Goals*: Provide clear project goals, objectives, and expectations to ensure interns understand what is expected of them.
2. *Regular Feedback and Check-ins*: Schedule regular feedback sessions and check-ins to ensure interns are on track and address any concerns or questions.
